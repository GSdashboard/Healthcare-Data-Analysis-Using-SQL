# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL

Purpose
This project focuses on predicting hospital readmission rates for patients with diabetes.

Data
The dataset's original source is available HERE. It comprises clinical care data from 130 U.S. hospitals over a ten-year period (1998 - 2008). The dataset is organized into two tables: one containing demographic data and the other containing health and clinical care data.

Tools Used
SQL Server was employed for data analysis, utilizing SQL queries such as JOINS, CASE WHEN, HAVING, Subqueries, etc.

Insights ðŸ’¡ðŸ“ˆ
The majority of patients stay in the hospital for 1 to 4 days, with the highest number of patients staying for 3 days.
A positive correlation is observed between the number of lab procedures a patient undergoes and their length of stay in the hospital.
No clear relationship or disparity is apparent between racial groups concerning the number of lab procedures.
Among various specialties, Cardiology performs the highest overall number of procedures. Examining department averages reveals that Thoracic Surgery and Cardiovascular/Thoracic Surgery have the highest average number of procedures relative to their patient volume.
Hospital readmissions within <30 days following initial discharge are identified.
A list of the top 50 patients with the highest number of medication and lab procedures was generated from the available data.

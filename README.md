# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL

Purpose: üîç

This project focuses on predicting hospital readmission rates for patients with diabetes.

Data: üìä

The dataset's original source is available HERE https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008. It comprises clinical care data from 130 U.S. hospitals over a ten-year period (1998 - 2008). The dataset is organized into two tables: one containing demographic data and the other containing health and clinical care data.

Tools Used: üõ†Ô∏è

SQL Server was employed for data analysis, utilizing SQL queries such as JOINS, CASE WHEN, HAVING, Subqueries, etc.

Key Insights: üí°

Patient Stay Duration:

Analysis reveals that the majority of patients experience hospital stays ranging from 1 to 4 days, with a peak at 3 days. This foundational insight sets the stage for further investigation into factors affecting length of stay.

Correlation with Lab Procedures:

A positive relationship emerges between the number of lab procedures undergone by patients and their length of stay. Patients undergoing more lab procedures tend to have longer hospital stays, suggesting a potential area for targeted interventions.

Racial Disparities:

Exploration of racial groups does not indicate a clear relationship or disparity concerning the number of lab procedures, providing a basis for a nuanced examination of healthcare equity.

Specialties and Procedures:

Identification of the highest-performing medical specialties, such as Cardiology, and examination of departmental averages for procedures offer valuable insights into healthcare service distribution and performance.

Readmission Patterns:

The project identifies instances of hospital readmissions within less than 30 days following initial discharge, shedding light on potential areas for improvement in post-discharge care.

Top Patients by Medication and Lab Procedures:

A curated list of the top 50 patients with the highest number of medication and lab procedures provides a focused view of individuals with complex healthcare needs.

Conclusion: üìà

Through systematic analysis using SQL, this project endeavors to contribute meaningful insights to the field of healthcare, aiding in the refinement of strategies to enhance patient care and mitigate hospital readmission rates for individuals with diabetes.
